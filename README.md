# Forem Browser Extension

This is a fairly functional work-in-progress. Let's try to keep it clean and functionally minimal as we evolve it.

- Currently the code is written for Chrome, but I _think_ this should be able to share 99% of the code with Firefox as long as we take care to do that early on.
- Forem logo is a placeholder.
- LInk to forem.com should link to a functional page, probably with discovery of new forems etc.
- We should add service workers to that functional forem page to remove the "flicker" when navigating there.
